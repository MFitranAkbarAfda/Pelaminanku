## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft pink (#F7D6E0), evoking sweetness and delicacy, suitable for a cake marketplace.
- Background color: Very light pink (#FDF2F4), nearly white, maintaining a bright and clean interface while harmonizing with the primary.
- Accent color: Pale lavender (#E0D8F7), an analogous hue to the pink that introduces a touch of sophistication and visual interest.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines, lending an elegant, high-end feel; 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body, maintaining readability in longer text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Floating footer with a minimalist 3D background to maintain visual interest without obstructing content.
- Use of subtle hover effects on CTAs (bubble effect) and interactive elements to provide feedback and engage users.
- Sliding and fade-in effects throughout the landing page to guide the user's eye and add a layer of polish.
